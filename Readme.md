# Movie Watchlist

##### Add movies to your watchlist.

Add movies to your watchlist which are fetched using [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

You can easily add any movie to your watchlist which will be stored in local storage.

Tried to make the code dry, but there is always room for improvement and I'm just starting up. 

Really enjoyed this fun solo project which was suggested by [Bob Ziroll](https://github.com/bobziroll) from scrimba's [Front-end Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).
